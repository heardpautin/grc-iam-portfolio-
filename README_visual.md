# 🚀 GRC & IAM Portfolio Artifacts

Welcome to my **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** and **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** portfolio!  
This repository showcases real-world access governance, role-based access control (RBAC), and compliance documentation mapped to key industry standards like **ISO/IEC 27001** and **NIST 800-53**.

## 🛡️ Artifacts Included

- **📊 RBAC Matrix (CSV)**  
  Generalized mappings of roles, applications, and permissions based on a financial institution context.  
  Aligns job functions with access levels while enforcing least privilege and compliance controls.

- **📄 GRC Control Documentation Template (Markdown)**  
  Structured documentation of critical controls such as **User Access Provisioning** and **Information Classification**, built to meet audit and governance requirements.

## 🔐 Privileged Access Management Note

> **Important:**  
> The **IT Administrator** role represents privileged user management functions such as those performed by Azure AD’s **User Administrator** role.  
> While not always a Global Admin, it can reset passwords, manage accounts, and assign roles—posing a significant security risk if compromised.  
> Therefore, **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and **strict access reviews** are essential.  
> This aligns with **ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.9.4.1** and supports **Zero Trust** principles.

## 💡 Usage

- As a governance reference for mapping access to roles  
- For internal/external **compliance audits**  
- As a **portfolio artifact** demonstrating real-world GRC/IAM knowledge in interviews
