## **High-Risk Findings**
- **IT Administrator – Privileged Access**  
  - Elevated rights to Active Directory & Entra ID pose a critical risk if compromised.  
  - **Recommendation:** Enforce PIM activation, MFA, and just-in-time access. Review activity logs weekly.
- **Backup Operator – Write/Restore Access**  
  - Ability to overwrite or restore backups could lead to data loss or corruption.  
  - **Recommendation:** Limit restore permissions to maintenance windows, enforce encryption, and review restore logs.
- **Incident Response Analyst – SIEM & Security Tools (Read/Write)**  
  - Access allows for modifying incident data and suppressing alerts.  
  - **Recommendation:** Implement change-approval workflows and log all modifications.

## **Accounts Requiring Review/Removal**
- **Vendor Management Manager**  
  - Review all active vendor accounts; remove stale or expired vendor access.
- **Bank Teller (ATM Management System – Read Only)**  
  - Validate that all teller accounts are tied to current employees; restrict access outside of assigned shifts.
- **Security Guard (Building Access System – Physical Access)**  
  - Confirm badge deactivation for departed personnel; align reviews with quarterly badge audits.

## **Compliance Gaps**
- **Quarterly Review Cadence:**  
  - Access reviews for Audit Analysts and Risk Supervisors are not consistently logged; may not meet ISO 27001 A.9.2.5 requirements.
- **Segregation of Duties (SoD):**  
  - Backup Operator and IT Administrator roles may overlap in certain environments; potential conflict needs documentation.
- **Vendor Management Control (A.9.2.1):**  
  - Vendor offboarding controls need improved documentation to meet NIST AC-2(3).

## **Overall Summary**
The quarterly access review shows that the majority of access aligns with job functions and ISO 27001/NIST 800-53 control requirements. However:
- **Privileged roles** (IT Administrator, Backup Operator) remain the highest risk and require enhanced monitoring.
- **Vendor and physical access controls** need stronger lifecycle management.
- Documentation and audit evidence collection must improve to ensure compliance with **A.9.2.5 (Access Rights Review)**.

**Next Steps:**  
- Implement recommended access changes.  
- Document remediation activities for the next audit cycle.  
- Schedule follow-up review in **3 months**.
