# GRC & IAM Portfolio Artifacts

This repository contains Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) artifacts designed to demonstrate role-based access control (RBAC) principles and compliance documentation aligned to industry standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST 800-53.

## Artifacts Included

- **RBAC Matrix (CSV)**  
  A generalized role-to-application access mapping for a financial institution context (e.g., credit union). This matrix aligns organizational roles, systems, and permissions with relevant security and compliance controls.

- **GRC Control Documentation Template (Markdown)**  
  Sample documentation for key controls such as User Access Provisioning and Information Classification, reflecting industry frameworks and regulatory requirements.

## Privileged Access Management Note

> **Note:**  
> The **IT Administrator** role represents privileged user management functions such as those performed by the Azure AD **User Administrator** role.  
> While this role may not have full Global Administrator rights, it can reset passwords, manage accounts, and assign roles, posing significant security risk if compromised.  
> Therefore, applying **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and **strict access reviews** is essential to enforce least privilege and reduce attack surface.  
> This control aligns with ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.9.4.1 and supports Zero Trust security principles.

## Usage

- This repository can be used as a governance tool to map access permissions to roles.  
- It serves as documentation for internal or external compliance audits.  
- It provides practical examples for interviews to demonstrate GRC and IAM knowledge.
