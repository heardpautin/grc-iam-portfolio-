This repository contains Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) artifacts, focusing on role-based access control and access governance aligned to industry standards.

## Artifacts

### Department Role Access Summary (GRC-Aligned)

This spreadsheet generalizes role-based access control (RBAC) mappings for a financial institution context, such as a credit union. It aligns organizational roles, systems, and access permissions with relevant security and compliance frameworks.

The document demonstrates how access is provisioned and limited based on job function and business need, supporting key governance frameworks like ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53. It documents access levels, scheduling constraints (e.g., days access is required), and control objectives, serving as evidence for compliance audits and access reviews.

## Microsoft Entra & Cloud Identity Alignment

This portfolio demonstrates role-based access control (RBAC) principles that directly map to Microsoft Entra Identity Governance features:

- **Access Packages** bundle roles, resource access, and policies for simplified user onboarding.  
- **Conditional Access** enforces adaptive, risk-based controls to ensure least privilege.  
- **Entitlement Management** supports delegated access reviews and lifecycle management.  
- **Managed Identities** enable secure service-to-service authentication, complementing human user access.

I am actively expanding this portfolio with hands-on labs and projects targeting the [SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/sc-300/) certification and other Microsoft Entra learning paths:  

- [Microsoft Entra Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/)  
- [Access Packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/governance/access-packages-overview)  
- [Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview)  
- [Entitlement Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview)

## Usage

This repository and its artifacts can be used as:

- A governance tool to map access permissions to roles.  
- Documentation for internal or external audits.  
- A sample for interviews showcasing real-world GRC/IAM knowledge.

*This example is generalized to protect proprietary information but is based on real-world IAM governance concepts.*
