# ✨🚀 GRC & IAM Portfolio Artifacts 🚀✨

Welcome to my **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** and **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** portfolio!  
This repository demonstrates **real-world RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**, compliance documentation, and access governance aligned to **ISO/IEC 27001** and **NIST 800-53** standards.

## 🔐 Privileged Access Management Note

> **Important:**  
> The **IT Administrator** role represents privileged user management functions like those in Azure AD’s **User Administrator** role.  
> While not always a Global Admin, it can reset passwords, manage accounts, and assign roles—posing a significant security risk if compromised.  
> To mitigate, apply **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and **strict access reviews**.  
> Aligns with **ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.9.4.1** and supports **Zero Trust** security principles.
